                </p>
                <h3>The Authority of PAGCOR</h3>
                <p>
                    PAGCOR serves as the primary regulatory body for all gaming activities within the Philippine territory. This government-owned and controlled corporation has a wide-ranging mandate that extends beyond traditional land-based casinos to encompass the burgeoning online gaming sector.
                </p>
                <h3>Regulatory Framework for Online Gaming</h3>
                <p>
                    When it comes to internet-based gaming platforms, PAGCOR has established a robust regulatory framework. This framework ensures that online casinos operate within legal boundaries, maintain fair gaming practices, and protect the interests of players.
                </p>
                <h3>Types of Gaming Licenses</h3>
                <p>
                    PAGCOR issues various types of licenses for different gaming operations. For online platforms, these may include licenses for:
                </p>
                <ul>

                    Each license type comes with its own set of requirements and regulations, tailored to the specific gaming activity.
                </p>
                <h3>Benefits of Choosing a PAGCOR-Licensed Casino</h3>
                <p>
